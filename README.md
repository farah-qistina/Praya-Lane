Edwin Sim, former resident of Praya Lane in the 1960s - 1970s recalled... 
“...the time when the sky turned red over the kampung (village) and everyone came out to bang on their gongs and cookery to prevent the dragon from swallowing the sun. 
# Sketch the scene of the village under a red sky, with everyone rushing out of their homes banging gongs and cookware.
Many decades later when researcing paths of typhoon in the South China Sea, I stumbled upon records of a typhoon that passed through the Straits of Malacca around the same time. I think that was what made the sky turn red in 1971.”

Evelyn Lowe shared about Intrudu (introduction to a new season) or also known as Water Day - celebrated on the last Sunday before Ash Wednesday where people would celebrate this day throwing water at each other. The whole village participated. And in return each has to give them a sip of brandy to drink to warm their bodies. Cakes will be sold. And later in the evening branyo rudia is performed where they would go around singing kristang songs in the neighbourhood.

Cecelia explained the conversion story of the Gan Family. Mr Gan was a poor fisherman who is not Catholic but he would always acknowledge the statue of Our Lady before he went out to sea. Those days, all the fishermen’s boats were docked just behind the chapel where the shore is. One day he saw his boat muddy and he was thinking to himself why these children (village kids) must dirty his boat. He cleaned it and went out, and to his surprise he came back with a plentiful catch. The next day, it was the same thing. He acknowledged Our Lady and saw his boat dirty again. Grumbling to himself, he cleaned his boat, came back with a plentiful catch. On the third day he decided to watch from afar to catch the children who were dirtying his boat. But the whole night, he did not see anyone. When he went out to his boat the next morning, he was puzzled, he did not see anyone playing on his boat but it was muddy. At that point he turned and saw the feet of the statue covered in mud. Immediately he knew, it was the statue of Our Lady, walking in his boat as if blessing his boat for abundant catch. From that day onwards, his whole family converted and became Catholics.
